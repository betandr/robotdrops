# Robot Drops

Robot Drops is an automatic system built a the Midem Hack Day 2015 which creates a pallette of 'drops' (like 'needle drops'*) which can be triggered to form a live remix. Robot Drops uses the Echonest API to scan an MP3 and chops it up into musically-meaningful chunks which can then be triggered to create a live performance.

Robot Drops also provides some drum loops at the same BPM as the MP3 it has chopped up which you can use to augment the MP3. For this, Robot Drops uses [Donk As A Service](https://github.com/betandr/donk) which was also built at the Midem Hack Day to build drum loops at the correct BPM.

_* The needle drop is a technique used in hip hop deejaying. The DJ sets a record spinning, then drops the stylus on the turntable at the exact point where he wants playback to begin without previously cuing up the record._
